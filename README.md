# Audio-Switcher
I created Audio Switcher to be able to easily hotswap between two audio outputs at the click of an icon on your desktop or hotbar.

I frequently switch between using my headset when on calls, or my soundbar for other entertainment. opening the audio mixer can get tedious, especially if you're in a rush and/or doing it several times a day. 
Audio Switcher was created to do that for you at the double click of an icon! You can use the settings app I built to configure which sources you want to toggle between:

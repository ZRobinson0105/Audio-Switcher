# Audio-Switcher
I create Audio Switcher to be able to easily hotswap between two audio outputs at the click of an icon on your desktop or hotbar.

I frequently switch between using my headset when on calls, or my soundbar for other entertainment. opening the audio mixer can get tedious, especially if you're in a rush and/or doing it several times a day. 
Please see the license for usage, otherwise enjoy!
